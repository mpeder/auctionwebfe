# Online Auction
This site is for the open hack "Online Auction".

You can find the case description [here](https://github.com/mpeder/onlineauction/blob/master/docs/case-description.md).

There is a simple starting front end created for you [here](https://github.com/mpeder/onlineauction/tree/master/auction-front-end). It is based on .NET Core and Razor Pages. You dont have to use it :-)

Some additional help for getting started is available [here](https://github.com/mpeder/onlineauction/blob/master/docs/getting-started-coding.md)
